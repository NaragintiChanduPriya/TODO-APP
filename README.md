# TODO-APP

This project demonstrates a basic todo app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add tasks, mark them as done, and save their todo list in local storage.

## Features

1. **Add Tasks**:
   - Users can input new tasks and add them to the todo list.
   - Press the "Add" button or hit Enter to add a task.

2. **Mark Tasks as Done**:
   - Click on a task to mark it as done.
   - The task will be visually updated to indicate completion.

3. **Remove Tasks**:
   - Users can remove tasks from the list.
   - Click the "Remove" button next to a task to delete it.

4. **Local Storage**:
   - The app stores the todo list in the browser's local storage.
   - Even after closing the browser, the tasks will persist.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Add tasks, mark them as done, and see the changes reflected in the app.

## How It Works

- The `index.html` file contains the structure of the todo app.
- The `styles.css` file provides styling rules for the app components.
- The `script.js` file handles the logic for adding, marking, and removing tasks.
